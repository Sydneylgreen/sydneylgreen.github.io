              <p>Hi and welcome to my own personal website! I am super excited to have the chance to showcase my new skills in Web and 
                get to share a little bit about my life!
              </p>
        
              <p>I am a senior in college this year at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am majoring in Marketing with a Minor in Creative Technology and
                Design. I am originally from the outskirts of Chicago but I decided to come out to Colorado for the mountains and the outdoors!
              </p>
        
              <p>This upcoming year I really plan to utilize the outdoors and to get outside as much as I can.
                My favorite hobbies include, hiking, skiing, and exploring. I am hoping that inbetween my classes and my busy work schedule
                that I can find time to do the things that I really love to do. I would also love to get back into swimming this year. 
                I was a competetive swimmer most of my life and I really would love to get back in the water again.
              </p>
        
              <p>When I look towards the future, I see nothing but possibilities. I would ideally love to stay in Colorado and land a job in Denver.
                However, I also would not mind traveling back home and landing a job in Chicago. I hope that wherever I go, tha I 
                love what I do and that it allows me to put the creative side of my brain to good use.
              </p>
        
              <p>All in all, I am very excited to carry out my last year here at Boulder and to see what the future holds for me!</p>
