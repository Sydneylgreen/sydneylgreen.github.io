            Project 1: Expressive Booklet Through Typeography
          </h2>

          <h3>
            For this project I was tasked with designing a printed accordion book that typographically expresses a song lyric or poem of my own choosing. My book displays a portion of my chosen source in an expressive way that helps convey the mood and feeling of the chosen source.

            Project 2: Type Font Poster
          </h2>

          <h3>
            In this project I was tasked with creating a type specimen piece of design that demonstrates the range of a typeface, applied to headlines and text in a variety of sizes. Type specimens today can be wildly flamboyant or classical in their approach, but should work with the chosen typeface to highlight its style, features, and unique characteristics. For this project I created a type specimen poster for the typeface of my choice which was Menlo.

            Project 3: Abstracted Apples Poster
          </h2>

          <h3>
            For this project I was tasked with taking one of my own apple sketches from a lecture and adapting it into a digital mock up for a t-shirt design. I had to remember the tone my class group selected, but push my design into a very abstract direction. Our selective tone was persuasive, so I thought designing a mouth to make the apple look delicious would send the persuasive message that buying apples means eating delicious food.

            Project 4: Poster Mailer Project
          </h2>

          <h3>
            My task for this project was to create an informational poster mailer (printed and folded) with a provided concert schedule for the Colorado Symphony. The design needed to be primarily typographic, not use photographs, and Geometric shapes are allowed. I chose a weather theme and tailored my project around the clouds and rain.
